# Student-Information-system Project Decription :
Develop a Student Information System using Java Technologies ( JDBC, Servlets, Jsp ) following the MVC design pattern and three tier
architecture. The system will provide a user-friendly inteface for student login, data entry, storage in a JDBC database, and display of student
details in a grid format.
Key Features :
Login Page :
Create a simple login page for student to enter their credentals (e.g., username and password)
Implement authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
Student Details Form ( JSP ) :
Design a JSP page with a form to capture student details, including fields such as Name,sno, Course, Email and Gender.
Ensure proper validation for the form inputs to amintain data integrity.
Servlets (Controller ) :
Implement a servlet acting as the controller to handle requerts from the JSP pages.
Use the servlet to process login requests, validat user credentials.
DAO Layer ( Data Access Object ) :
Develop a DAO layer to interact with the database. Include methods ti insert student details into the database and retrieve student
information for display.
JDBC Database :
Set up a relational database ( e.g.,MySql ) to store student information.
Create a table to store student details with appropriate columns ( e.g. Name, Sno, Course, email,Gender )
Insertion Of Student Details :
Upon from submission use the servlet to capture the entered data.
Call the DAO layer to insert the student details into the database.
Display Student in Grid Format ( JSP ) :
Create a JSP page to display student information in a grid format
Retrive Data From MVC Design Pattern :
Follow the MVC desig pattern with clear separation of concerns.
Model : Represent the student data structure and database interactions in the DAO layer.
View : Use JSP pages for the user interface.
Controller : Implement servlets to manage the flow of data between the view and the model.
Exception Handling :
Implement proper exception handling throughout the application to manage errors gracefully. Display meaningful error messages to user
in case of any issues.
This Student information System project will provide a hands-on experience inbuilding a web application using Java technologies and the
MVC design pattern. It covers essential aspects such as user authentication, data validation, database interactions, and data dsiplay
